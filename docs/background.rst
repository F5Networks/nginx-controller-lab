The ACME Financial story
========================

ACME Financial was founded in 1965.
During the 1980 recession in America, ACME Financial spun off its lending division to provide better service for its customers. This created a Lending business unit within the company.
ACME Financial's lending business unit was successful in the recovery following the recession. 
In 2001 the Lending business unit branched into the retail personal finance space.
In 2020 that retail (personal finance) space embarked on a new trading platform for customers.

In this exercise we will be working with the lending business unit and various folks supporting the retail efforts. Specifically, we will engage with David, Olivia, Tony, and Samantha.

- David is a network engineer is responsible for the overall NGINX Controller platform. He is responsible for core network routing and corresponding security requirements in the lending business unit.

- Olivia, a DevOps engineer, is responsible for curating the pipelines and the NGINX configurations.

- Tony, an application developer is responsible for portions of the core service center applications.

- Samantha works in the Retail Business Unit. She is responsible for DevOps pipelines and getting the new trading and other apps to market.
