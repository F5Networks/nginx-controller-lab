| ACME Financial was founded in 1965.                                                         |
| In the 1980's during the American recession, ACME Financial spun off a lending division to  |
| provide better service for  customers.                                                      |
| The new Lending business unit was successful during the recovery following the recession,   |
| and grew to become a key part of the ACME Financial portfolio.                              |
| In 2001 the Lending business unit expanded into the retail personal finance space.          |
| In 2020 this retail space is building a new trading platform for customers.                 |
| In this exercise we'll be working with the lending business unit, as well as some of the    |
| people supporting the retail area in particular.                                            |
